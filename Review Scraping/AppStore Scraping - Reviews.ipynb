The biometric face recognition has worked whenever I‚Äôve used it too, I‚Äôm getting quite a boffin! I‚Äôve recently tried to open a new bank account on behalf of a club I‚Äôm in, and had to do it through the Nat West website, using an online form. Hmm, come on Nat West that was a real pain and pretty fiddly, certainly not customer friendly with all the complicated questions ( even if  I do understand the reason you need to ask). It can take up to 6 weeks to open a club current account! No one at the branch could or would help when I was stuck. Online chat was next to useless.

I've had it for a while and the first version only allowed to transfer between accounts which was okay but not too helpful. Now I can pay bills on the go whenever I want. I like the security feature that means you have to pay a bill from your online account before you can make a payment from the app when you set up a new payee. Have just had my phone replaced because of a fault and had problems as the app kept saying Service Unavailable - phone the 0808 number helpline (using 0800 wizard) and the guy advised deleting and reinstalling the app. Took a couple of minutes to reinstall and get logged back in - great service.\",\n",

Maybe needs a bug fix for this?\\nThe second being that if you add a payee via the app that payee has a limited daily payment amount. So really unless it‚Äôs a one off payment of less than ¬£750 to this person you have to really add a new payee via the desktop online banking. Would be great if you could do this via the app using the card reader maybe?\\n\\nThanks',\n",
