2,"Your Private Banking service has caused me to believe that customers with substantial sums at the bank are neglected and overlooked.
I have this impression after years of loyalty with BoS.
Other banks are so much more customer focussed, looking at ways of assisting in increasing wealth and security. I have only ever experienced BoS as a bank of self-interest. Nobody has even asked what I would want to do with the millions lying practically dormant in a deposit account.
My recent experience of communication, especially with regarding to a recent major bank account fraud has left me wondering where I should transfer all my funds as the security procedures in the bank are not as solid as advertised and you are simply not interested in me as a private banking customer.",Aboomah,No contact,2019-11-08 15:50:29,,False,5

Below is my original review. 

All the basics are there. Overall quite impressed. 

My only major issue is that there is no password manager support. Since all of my passwords are 25+ characters, it is very annoying to have to type in each character copying from another screen or by popping in and out of the app. It doesn‚Äôt even let you paste a password into the field!

1402,"I had made 2 or 3 false starts. When I re-enquired about online banking in your Dumfries branch, the member of staff recognised my oldish-&-not-very-tech-savvy appearance (that‚Äôs a thing by the way) and decided to help me decide passwords and she wrote them for me on a bank of Scotland card which I still have with me (since August 2016). She nailed it for me, and online banking at least with my bank of Scotland accounts, became a reality. And I can‚Äôt begin to tell you how much value I have obtained from it. I wish I had taken her name so I could send a specific thanks.

On a different note, I was sadly disappointed at the lack of support that the bank gave when I had significant losses due to fraud on my account. We changed the card a few times before eventually starting a new account entirely.  I had lost at least ¬£9,000 and possibly up to ¬£12,000. I had cause to learn that some of the same sources of the fraud had carried out other fraud that the bank were aware of. And the format of the losses would have acted as proof as I was told that no games console could physically hold the number of premium games that had been bought. 

Sorry I went off track. I have many reasons to praise the Bank of Scotland, amongst them the kind woman who helped an old-ish man finally come to grips with internet banking. But that particular situation disappointed me as I had seen other banks deal with similar issues more honourably, treating their customer like a client (‚Äòsomeone who is under their care, protection and guidance‚Äô) and felt that Bank of Scotland did very little if anything to help.

1490,"Update Sep 12 - still dreadful. The basic account information is there, along with payment functionality (which is very onerous but works). It's just the completely dreadful interface and usability that lets it down so badly. Awkward to log in. Doesn't use familiar IOS button and functionality conventions.  ATM information is wholly inaccurate and unreliable. Really bad menus and navigation. Amateurish and very basic. Typical Lloyds, sadly - take everything to the most basic offering, no value add, no customer consideration. 

Original review July 12 - 
The basic functionality is there, in terms of account viewing, payments, transfers, but the user interface design is decidedly clunky and poorly done. 

It's buggy too - clicking on some of the footer buttons make the app crash. 

And the quality of branch and ATM data is very poor - the Old Broad Street branch is titled ""London Old Broad BoS"", other banks' ATM's are not identified by bank name, and St Helens WA10 is apparently just a third of a km from London SW10!!

All in all, a disappointingly amateurish offering, clearly done on the cheap without any thought to interface nor innovation.",Scottish Londoner,Amateur attempt,2012-09-13 23:01:50,,False,5

1492,"I'm hugely angry about this update. The old app worked perfectly fine and I resent finding after an update that I have to re-register. It meant being unable to access my accounts to transfer money until I'd returned home to answer an obnoxious automated phonecall that took several attempts to work. The new interface is also terrible - I don't want to 'swipe' between my accounts, it's idiotic. For some reason the app also uses it's own keypad graphic that's harder to use due to the keys flashing too quickly after typing for you to ascertain if you've hit the right character, leading to having to repeatedly re-enter your password as you've got it wrong without realising it. Also, I don't want a quicker login - I liked that I had to enter three different sets of information to access my accounts. My banking being a mere three digits away from anyone with access to my phone doesn't fill me with confidence. Since installing this update accidentally I've repeatedly hesitated from registering as I've been in two minds about whether or not it might actually be a phishing scam. The whole experience has been very unpleasant. This update was an unnecessary frivolity, it's insulting.",Applemonopoly,Completely infuriating,2014-01-19 11:12:51,,False,1
1493,"This is a good app. It's definitely one of the better apps available from UK banks. It offers a lot more than just checking balances and doing simple transfers, which is great.

However, it does feel like we're getting to the stage where simply emulating the functionality of online banking on a smaller screen is no longer enough. It's time for mobile banking apps to innovate and add true mobile features. For example, why can I only get alerts by text? Why not let me get iOS notifications for a wider variety of activities? It would be great if I could get an alert every time a payment hits my account, or if I go overdrawn, or if my card is used abroad. And why not let me quickly view my balances in the iOS notification centre, or on my Apple Watch? Going ""Mobile-first"" is a growing trend, but it's clear it hasn't quite hit Bank of Scotland yet.

Also, the iPhone 6 S is out today. How is it possible that this app still doesn't support the iPhone 6/6 Plus screen sizes?",JacksterD92,"OK, but one year on and still no iPhone 6 screen support?",2015-09-25 01:18:40,,False,3

It is a good start and I'm glad to see HBOS finally catching up with mobile browsers. It's not really an app though more a stripped back site. I think it could do with a de clutter and be a bit more intuitive. HBOS should remember who their target market is and know that most people using this app only want to quickly check funds and transfer funds. They also want to do this quickly so it would be a nice feature if once the users logged in with all their credentials then they have the ability to set up a four digit pin number so that next log in, they just enter their pin to log in. O2s app has this and I think it's a great time saver. I hope HBOS is listening to all this feedback",DarkParallel,A few bugs,2011-12-22 11:29:38,,False,3

I expect a few seconds but I can sit for 15, 20, often over 30 seconds as the little circle does its thing whilst my device is apparently authenticated. 

I understand the importance of security given the functions of the app but some explanation from the developers as to why there is this significant delay in start up alongside a commitment to ensure it is fixed would go some way to tempering my irritation. It has actually got to the stage that I am considering switching banks as almost all my banking, until recently, has been done using the app.

Once eventually in the app l don't really have much complaints as it pays bills, contacts, transfers etc quickly and effectively so does the job intended, but notifications for balance alerts, direct debits and likes that the SMS alerts offer could be an added bonus, (although maybe the night before instead of silly hours like 4am could be better.

In short, this is a lazily-written app that in many places simply displays web pages in a more awkward way than a standard browser.
